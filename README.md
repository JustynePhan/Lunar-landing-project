# Lunar-landing-project


- This repository contains code for training an AI agent using Deep Q-Learning to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI Gym.
- The agent learns to navigate a lunar lander to a designated landing pad using thrusters while avoiding crashing or landing outside the pad.
- To train the DQN agent, run the `Deep_Q_Learning_for_Lunar_Landing.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment or any Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks.
- The trained agent's performance can be visualized using the provided function `show_video_of_model()` in the notebook. It generates a video showing the agent navigating the lunar lander.
- Contributions to the project are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.- **Installation**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
